  <h3>In addition to fulfilling goal 11.7, we also aim to fulfill goal 11.3 as well. By improving accessibility regardless of gender, age, nationality, race or disability, we believe everyone should be accessible to every part of the city - including those from rural areas and slums, potentially increasing urbanisation as well.</h3>

  <h2>Our goal to improve accessibility</h2>

  <h3>Smart and accessible parking throughout the city</h3>
  <p>By installing smart and accessible parking, we are able to accomodate for everyone regardless of race, gender, age nationality or disability. For example, we could have reserved parkings for disabled, senior citizens, family parking, electric vehicles as well as others as well. </p>
  
  <p>
  	In addition, we could have gate-less and ticketless parking system. With current technological advancements such as RFID and NFC, we hope that in the future we could allow the payment of parking automatically by taking advantage of mobile apps, RFID and NFC chips on cars as well as on parking lots.
