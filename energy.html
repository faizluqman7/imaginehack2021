  <h3>LED Light Bulbs everywhere around the city</h3>
  <p>By installing LED light bulbs in street lamps, cafe's, restaurants, offices and homes, we are able to reduce the need for energy for lighting up our environments. Since LED light bulbs consume significantly less energy compared to the traditional CFL light bulbs, it draws less power from the sockets and thus saving energy.</p>
  <p>
  	In addition, some LED bulbs allow you to control its operations(on/off/colour) using a mobile app or smart devices such as google home, Alexa or Apple HomePod.
