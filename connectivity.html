  <h3>With the aim of fulfilling target 11.7, in addition to bringing accessibility to outdoor green spaces in the city, we must also provide facilities for the citizens that use these spaces. To do this, one of the best ways is by providing full internet coverage not only across the spaces, but across the whole city. </h3>

  <h3>SpaceX Starlink dishes in low network coverage areas </h3>
  <p>Starlink, which is one of the projects of SpaceX, allows the inclusion of high speed internet connectivity anywhere around the world. In secluded areas in the city, where the coverage of WiFi is very limited, Starlink dishes can help to provide high-speed network. Even in open commercial outdoor spaces where there is a possibility of a bad network connecivity, this problem can easily be addressed with the help of Starlink.</p>

  <h3>5G high speed cellular connectivity across the whole city</h3>
  <p>5G has become one of the most promising cellular network generations. It has the potential reach speeds of up to 10GBPS and thus proving cellular has evolved more than ever. By implementing 5G in our city, we are able to connect with friends and family easily thus making the city more evolved than ever.</p>
